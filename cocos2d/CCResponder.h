/**
  CCResponder is the base class for all nodes.
  It exposes the touch and mouse interface to any node, which enables user interaction.
  It is somewhat similar to [UIResponder](https://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIResponder_Class/index.html).
 
  To make a responder react to user interaction, the touchesXXX / mouseXXX event must be overridden in your node subclass.
  If a class does not implement these selectors, the event will be passed on to the next node in the Cocos2D responder chain.
  To force the events to be passed to next responder, call the super implementation before returning from the event.
 
 ### Subclassing Notes
 You should not create subclasses of CCResponder. Instead subclass from CCNode if you need a plain basic node, or other node classes that best fit the purpose.
 
 @note To handle touch events, the touchBegan method must always be overridden (implemented) in your node's subclass. It may remain empty.
 Otherwise the other touch events will not be received either if touchBegan is not implemented.

 Called when a touch began. Behavior notes:
 
 - If a touch is dragged inside a node which does not claim user interaction, a touchBegan event will be generated.

 - To pass the touch further down the Cocos2D responder chain, call the super implementation, ie [super touchBegan:withEvent:].
